# Typeset linguistic examples with the Simplest Syntax possible

This is a [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst) package that provides linguistic examples and interlinear glossing. It is a heavily modified fork of [neunenak's typst-leipzig-glossing](https://github.com/neunenak/typst-leipzig-glossing).

# Example

Numbered lists are treated as subexamples, and bullet lists â€” as glosses. Typesetting an example is as simple as

```typst
#import "@preview/eggs:0.1.0": example as ex, judge as j, abbreviations
#import abbreviations: pl, ins
#show: eggs

#ex[
  + - primer   s     gloss-ami
    - example  with  gloss-#pl.#ins
    'an/the example with glosses'
  + #j[\*]example without glosses
]
```
